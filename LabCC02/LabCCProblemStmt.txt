Create a Nav Bar with Menu Items
Home
About
Products
Services
Contact

When each of the Menu Item is selected the respective DropDown should be available
but here atleast create one drop down for "Products"
with the options:

Electronics
Cosmetics
Home Applicances
Hardware
Software

Without Using Descendant selectors like nth child, you can use 
pseudo class selector like a: hover / link etc
